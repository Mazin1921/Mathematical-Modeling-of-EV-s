# Mathematical Modelling of Electric Vehicles on MATLAB Simulationâš¡ðŸš—

## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code for mathematical modelling and simulation of electric vehicles (EVs). Explore various aspects of EV behavior, including dynamics, powertrain, and energy consumption.

## Structure

- `models/`: MATLAB scripts and functions implementing EV models.
- `docs/`: Documentation RAW Matlab files files.


## Getting Started

1. Clone/download the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the code directory.
3. Run example scripts to simulate EV models.
4. Analyze simulation results.
